# SQL Project: Analyzing Industry Carbon Emissions

Note that this was a project originally created by the team at DataCamp, and only the SQL query is my original work. This project is an analysis of PCFs (product carbon footprints) by industry within the most recent year that data within a particular dataset had been reported.

## Introduction

(The following was written on 8 Nov, 2024. Any updates to relevant dataset(s) are not accounted for.) 

The **_Carbon Catalog_** is a publicly available database that was featured in a 2022 Scientific Data article on nature.com.
As the team (Meinrenken, et.al.) who published this article describes, PCFs "are playing an increasing role in decisions around sustainability for companies and consumers." Hence, the researchers sought to present information on greenhouse gas emissions that can be used in LCAs (life cycle assessments) of various products. They used data reported by 145 international companies to the non-profit, CDP Worldwide, in order to analyze a dataset which consists of 866 commerical products. 

## Disclosure

A note from the Carbon Catalog database publishers:
*"We would like to emphasize that, other than the systemization and inferences of the data described herein, the original calculations of PCFs were carried out by each reporting company itself. Therefore, for detailed questions about e.g., assumptions and boundaries in the PCFs that cannot be answered from the meta data of each product in the database, readers are referred to the respective reporting company."*
